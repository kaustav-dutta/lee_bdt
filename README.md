## How to run

This module uses as input the TTree generated by the [PandoraLEEAnalyzer](https://github.com/soleti/1e1pFilter/tree/master/pandoraElectronFilter). 
First, we fill the tree that will be used by the BDT:

```python plots.py```

Then, to run the BDT and plot the results:

```source run_bdt.sh```
