# BDT Low Energy Excess analysis

## Requirements

- ROOT 6.04 or higher with TMVA and pyROOT support
- Python 3.4 or higher

## How to run

This module uses as input the TTree generated by the [PandoraLEEAnalyzer](https://github.com/soleti/1e1pFilter/tree/master/pandoraElectronFilter). 
First, we fill the tree that will be used by the BDT:

```python plots.py```

Then, we run the BDT training

```python bdt.py```

We apply the BDT to the Monte Carlo

```python mc_bdt.py```

and to the data. This last module produces all the plots.

```python data_bdt.py```
