# Low Energy Excess analysis

## Requirements

- ROOT 6.04 or higher with TMVA and pyROOT support
- Python 3.4 or higher

## How to run

This module uses as input the TTree generated by the [ElectronNeutrinoSelection](https://github.com/soleti/ElectronNeutrinoSelection) analyzer.
First, we fill the tree that will be used by the BDT:

```python fill.py```

Then, to run the BDT and plot the results:

```

python train.py
python run.py
python draw.py

```
